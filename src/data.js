During the recruitment process, the participants are formed into teams and asked to make a product that is useful for the community. After brainstorming with the team, we decided to work with coffee farmers who marketed coffee without high selling points, and redesigned the coffee packaging. As a result, we created a website that coffee farmers can use to market their coffee, and meet consumers at a higher selling price than before. This project can be completed in 3 weeks, with a lot of struggle in the manufacturing process. As a result, my team and I were successfully accepted into the BCC.",
